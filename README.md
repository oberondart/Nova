# Nova
Simple toy scripting language built entirely in Lua. This isn't really a serious project.
I made it for fun :)


output is used with "out()"
example: out("hello, world!")

you can create variables with the let() function
example: let(my_var, value)

you can use simple loops with the, you guessed it, loop() function!
example: 
loop(3, function()
    out("i'm nova :)")
end)
