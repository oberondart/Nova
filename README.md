# NovaScript
Simple toy scripting language built entirely in Lua 5.4. This isn't really a serious project.
I made it for fun :)

# About

# Download and Usage
To use NovaScript, simply download nova.lua and import it into your script. You can get a feel of the language by looking at functions in the standard library.
